main.py uses Divided Differences and Natural spline to interpolate a function.

You can change the function that you want to interpolate by changing the x points and y points in the array x and y.

Enter the number of points you have in the variable n.

main.py will automatically generate a plot.
The blue line is the Natural Spline interpolation.
The black line is the Divided Differences interpolation.
