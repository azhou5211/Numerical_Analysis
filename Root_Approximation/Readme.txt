Three methods of approximating a root:
	Bisection Method
	Newton Method
	Secant Method

Run the programs in python 3.
The following programs can be used to find a root of a function.
Bisection Method is guaranteed to converge to a root.
Newton and Secant Methods are not guaranteed to converge to a root, and eventually will time out.

These methods use approximation, and therefore print the amount of error it has from the actual value.
You can set the amount of error you want by changing the amount of error in the variable epsilon.

For Bisection Method:
You can change the initial starting points by changing a and b, where is a is the first point and b is the second point.

For Secant Method:
You can change the initial starting points by changing a and b, where is a is the first point and b is the second point.

For Newton's Methods:
You can change the initial starting points by changing a, where a is the starting point.
